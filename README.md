Source code and supplementary materials for "An Experiment Evaluation of Anomaly Detection in Time Series".

* Source code is available in `src` folder and jar package is in `lib` folder
* The dataset is too large to be kept in git, so we put it in Google Drive, https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BJuiWMmBzK2UeiGahVoX2ofqlShELjkN
