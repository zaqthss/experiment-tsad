Source code and supplementary materials for "An Experiment Evaluation of Anomaly Detection in Time Series [EB & A]".

* Source code is available in `src` folder and jar package is in `lib` folder
* The dataset is too large to be kept in git, so we put it in Google Drive as follows: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BJuiWMmBzK2UeiGahVoX2ofqlShELjkN?usp=sharing
* Extra experimental results can be found in the technical report here
